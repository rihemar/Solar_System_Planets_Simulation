# ðŸŒŒ Solar System Planets Simulation

An **interactive 3D solar system exploration tool** that lets users explore and inspect any planet from every angle using **hand gestures** and **wireless scrolling**. Built for the **INSAT Astronomy Club** Integration Day, this project serves as both an educational tool and an engaging way to spark curiosity about our solar system.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition:** Powered by **Mediapipe** and **OpenCV** (Python) to allow intuitive interaction.
- **3D Rendering:** Real-time 3D visualization using **Three.js**.
- **Planet Exploration:** Inspect planets from every angle and perspective.
- **Wireless Scrolling:** Navigate the solar system without needing a keyboard or mouse.
- **Educational Use:** Serves as an introductory experience about planets for students and new club members.
